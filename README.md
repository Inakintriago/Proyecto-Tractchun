# 📊 Tractchun - Technical Support Dashboard

## 📝 Context
In this project, an interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI to analyze the performance of technical support in a manufacturing company.  
The main objective was to monitor the ticket history from 2016 to 2020, integrating data from the ticketing system and the Human Resources department to gain a more comprehensive view of the service provided.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Creation of interactive dashboards.
- **Ticketing System**: Main source of operational data.
- **Human Resources Database**: To enrich the analysis with agent information.

## 📈 Results Analysis
- Visualization of trends in ticket opening and closing by day, month, and year.
- Analysis of key metrics:
  - Total tickets handled.
  - Average tickets per agent.
  - Average days open per ticket.
  - Average customer satisfaction.
- Identification of the most frequent ticket categories and average resolution time.
- Creation of an **agent ranking** based on performance, resolution times, and customer satisfaction.

## 📋 Conclusions
- The integration of Human Resources information allowed the identification of individual performance patterns that were not visible with just operational data.
- The dashboard facilitates decision-making by clearly highlighting areas of opportunity in IT management.
- It is recommended to use the findings to focus specific training on agents and optimize the ticket handling processes.
